# WireGuide Architecture & Design

## Overview

WireGuide is a **two-process** WireGuard VPN client:

- **GUI process** (unprivileged) — Wails v3 + Svelte webview, system tray, config editor
- **Helper process** (root) — wireguard-go TUN, routing, DNS, firewall, reconnect

They communicate over **JSON-RPC 2.0** on a Unix domain socket (`/var/run/wireguide/wireguide.sock`). The helper is installed as a macOS LaunchDaemon with `KeepAlive=true`.

## Why Two Processes?

WireGuard requires root to create TUN devices and modify routing tables. Rather than running the entire GUI as root:

- **GUI stays unprivileged** — a compromised webview can't touch the network stack
- **Helper does only privileged work** — smaller attack surface
- **Helper survives GUI restarts** — closing the window doesn't kill the VPN
- **LaunchDaemon KeepAlive** — helper auto-restarts on crash

This mirrors the architecture of `wg-quick` (which also runs as root) but wraps it in a persistent daemon with IPC.

## Multi-Tunnel Architecture

WireGuide supports **multiple simultaneous WireGuard tunnels**. The `tunnel.Manager` maintains a `map[string]*tunnelEntry` keyed by tunnel name, where each entry holds its own independent state:

```go
type tunnelEntry struct {
    state       domain.State
    engine      *Engine
    cfg         *domain.WireGuardConfig
    connectedAt time.Time
    netMgr      network.NetworkManager  // per-tunnel network state
}
```

### Per-Tunnel NetworkManager

Each tunnel gets its **own `NetworkManager` instance** created via `netMgrFactory` during `Connect()`. This ensures one tunnel's route/DNS cleanup cannot affect another. The manager propagates global settings (like pin interface) to each tunnel's `NetworkManager`.

### DNS Union

When multiple tunnels are active, DNS servers are merged into a **union set**. On connect, the new tunnel's DNS is merged with all existing tunnels' DNS via `AllDNSServers()`. On disconnect, if other tunnels remain, their combined DNS is re-applied through one of the remaining tunnels' `NetworkManager` instances.

### Full-Tunnel Conflict Detection

Only one full-tunnel (`0.0.0.0/0`) can be active at a time. `Connect()` rejects a new full-tunnel config if any existing connected tunnel is already routing all traffic, returning `ErrFullTunnelConflict`.

### Key Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Connect(cfg)` | Creates per-tunnel `NetworkManager`, runs connect phases, adds to `tunnels` map |
| `DisconnectTunnel(name)` | Tears down a specific tunnel by name |
| `DisconnectAll()` | Tears down all active tunnels (used during shutdown) |
| `Disconnect()` | Legacy single-tunnel compat: disconnects the first active tunnel |
| `ActiveTunnels()` | Returns sorted names of all connected/connecting tunnels |
| `AllStatuses()` | Returns `ConnectionStatus` for every tunnel entry |
| `StatusFor(name)` | Returns status of a specific tunnel |
| `AllDNSServers()` | Returns union of DNS servers from all connected tunnels |

## Connection Lifecycle

### Connect (Multi-Tunnel)

 │                            │── AssignAddress ─────────▶│

 │                            │── AddRoutes ─────────────▶│ 0.0.0.0/1, 128.0.0.0/1
 │                            │   └─ bypass routes ──────▶│ endpoint → gateway
 │                            │── SetDNS (union) ────────▶│ networksetup

 │◀── status: connected ──────│                           │
```

The manager lock (`mu`) is held only for state reads/writes, never during the slow phase operations (ifconfig, route, networksetup). This keeps `Status()` / `IsConnected()` / `ActiveTunnel()` non-blocking even while a long `Connect` or `Disconnect` is in flight.

### Disconnect

On disconnect, each tunnel cleans up via its own `NetworkManager`. If other tunnels remain active, their DNS union is re-applied. Crash-recovery state is cleared per-tunnel.

### Security Hardening: No Script Execution

Pre/PostUp/Down script execution has been **removed** as a security hardening measure. The config parser still accepts these fields so existing configs import without error, but the scripts are silently ignored.

### Endpoint DNS Resolution -- Chicken-and-Egg

Peer endpoints are resolved **before** installing split routes. If we resolved after, the DNS query itself would route through the tunnel (which isn't established yet), creating a loop.

```go
// engine.go: resolve FIRST, then routes
ips, _ := net.DefaultResolver.LookupHost(ctx, host)  // uses ISP DNS
// ... later in connect_phases.go ...
netMgr.AddRoutes(ifaceName, allowedIPs, ...)          // installs 0.0.0.0/1
// After this point, DNS queries go through tunnel — but endpoints are already resolved
```

This is the same approach wg-quick uses (`wg show <iface> endpoints` before `route add`).

## Network Management (macOS)

### DNS

DNS is applied to **every** network service (`networksetup -listallnetworkservices`), not just the primary one. macOS can switch primary between Wi-Fi and Ethernet mid-session.

Original DNS per service is saved in memory, restored on disconnect. For crash recovery (no memory), `ResetDNSToSystemDefault()` clears to DHCP defaults.

**Post-write verification**: after applying DNS, we read back to confirm at least one service accepted the change. macOS can silently drop DNS changes (MDM profiles, permission issues).

### Routes

**Split tunnel**: `0.0.0.0/1` + `128.0.0.0/1` via utunN (wg-quick approach).

**Endpoint bypass**: host routes for each peer endpoint via the upstream gateway. This prevents encrypted WG packets from looping through the tunnel.

### Pin Interface (`-ifscope`)

When WiFi and Ethernet are both active, macOS can flap between interfaces for bypass routes. `-ifscope <iface>` pins to a specific physical interface. The upstream interface is cached **before** split routes are installed (afterwards, `route get` would return utun).

Pin interface is a **Manager-level setting** (`SetPinInterface(bool)`). When toggled:
1. The setting is stored on the `Manager` struct
2. Propagated to every active tunnel's `NetworkManager` via the `SetPinInterface` interface
3. Applied to any future tunnels created via `Connect()`

Controlled via the `Network.SetPinInterface` IPC method from the GUI Settings panel.

### Route Monitor

Equivalent to wg-quick's `monitor_daemon`. Watches `route -n monitor` for kernel route table changes and:

1. Compares current gateway against cached value
2. If changed: deletes old bypass routes, re-adds with new gateway
3. Re-applies DNS (macOS can reassign on network switch)
4. Re-reads live endpoints from wgctrl (roaming support)

**Anti-loop protection**: caches `lastGatewayV4/V6` to skip spurious RTM events. Without this, our own `route add` commands trigger reapply in a tight loop.

## Kill Switch (macOS pf)

Rules are loaded into the `com.apple/wireguide` anchor (a slash, not a dot — the anchor MUST be nested under `com.apple` to be reached by macOS's `anchor "com.apple/*" all` wildcard in pf.conf; a dot-separated name is a syntactically-valid but completely unreferenced top-level anchor the kernel never evaluates, which is exactly what shipped for a while before this was caught). Given the slash nesting, our anchor is automatically evaluated — **we never modify the main ruleset**.

```
# WireGuide kill switch rules (loaded into anchor)
pass quick on lo0 all                           # loopback
pass out quick proto udp to 1.2.3.4 port 443   # WG endpoint
pass out quick proto tcp to 5.6.7.8 port 1194  # OpenVPN remote (protocol-aware, unlike WG)
pass out quick proto udp from any port 68 to any port 67  # DHCP
pass out quick proto udp from any port 546 to any port 547 # DHCPv6
pass quick on utun6 all                         # WG tunnel interface
pass quick on utun7 all                         # OpenVPN tunnel interface
anchor "dns"                                    # DNS sub-anchor — relative name, resolves to com.apple/wireguide/dns
block drop out all                              # block everything else
block drop in all
```

**Multi-protocol whitelisting**: `EnableKillSwitch(interfaceName, ifaceAddresses, endpoints, extra)` takes the WireGuard interface/endpoints as before, plus `extra []KillSwitchTunnel` for any other active tunnels (currently OpenVPN). Each OpenVPN tunnel's remote is resolved to a literal IP **once, at `Connect()` time** (`ovpn.Manager.resolveRemoteForKillSwitch`) — same principle as WireGuard's pre-resolved endpoints: resolving on-demand after the tunnel is already routing traffic risks the DNS query looping back through the tunnel itself. `interfaceName` may be empty for an OpenVPN-only session (no WireGuard tunnel active); `extra` covers that case instead — at least one of the two must be non-empty.

**Auto-refresh on connect/disconnect**: `EnableKillSwitch` itself is stateless about *what changed* — it just rebuilds the full ruleset from whatever the caller says is active right now. `Helper.enableKillSwitchNow()` gathers that "currently active" snapshot (WireGuard status + `ovpn.Manager.ActiveRemotes()`), and `Helper.refreshKillSwitchIfEnabled()` calls it — but only if the kill switch is already on — as a best-effort side effect after: WireGuard's `handleConnect`/`handleDisconnect`, and OpenVPN's `onActiveChange` callback (fired from `onMgmtState`'s CONNECTED transition and from `cleanup()`, deliberately NOT from the once-a-second bytecount update). This closes the gap where enabling the kill switch with tunnel A active, then connecting tunnel B, would leave B's traffic blocked until a manual re-toggle.

**Tracking OpenVPN's own internal reconnects**: `entry.remoteAddr` isn't just resolved once and frozen — OpenVPN's own `>STATE:` line reports fields "(e) address of remote server, (f) port of remote server" on every CONNECTED transition (see `management-notes.txt`), which `onMgmtState` uses to overwrite `entry.remoteAddr` with whatever OpenVPN is ACTUALLY using right now. Since switching remotes always requires OpenVPN to leave CONNECTED and go through RECONNECTING first (a TLS renegotiation can't happen mid-session), this transition is exactly what the `onActiveChange` hook above already watches — so a `remote`-directive failover or a round-robin DNS re-resolution correctly triggers both an updated `remoteAddr` and a kill-switch rebuild that whitelists it, with no separate mechanism needed. The `Connect()`-time DNS resolution (`resolveRemoteForKillSwitch`) is now just a best-effort seed for the brief window before the tunnel first reaches CONNECTED.

**Why anchor-only**: previous approach saved main pf rules via `pfctl -sr` and re-loaded with anchor reference. This broke on macOS Tahoe because `pfctl -sr` outputs `scrub-anchor` directives that cause syntax errors when fed back to `pfctl -f`.

## OpenVPN Challenge/Response (CRV1/SCRV1)

RADIUS/LDAP-backed 2FA gateways use OpenVPN's management-interface challenge/response protocol (see [management-notes.txt](https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/doc/management-notes.txt) in the OpenVPN source) instead of just concatenating an OTP onto the password. Two variants, both implemented in `internal/ovpn/management.go` (parsing) and `internal/ovpn/manager.go` (state/formatting):

- **SCRV1 (static)**: the server's very first `>PASSWORD:Need 'Auth' username/password` prompt carries an `SC:<flag>,<text>` suffix. The user answers with password + response together, in the SAME prompt — no extra round trip. `flag` bit 0 = echo the response as typed, bit 1 = concatenate password+response as plain text (vs. base64-encode both into `SCRV1:<pw_b64>:<resp_b64>`).
- **CRV1 (dynamic)**: the server accepts the base password first, THEN rejects it with `>PASSWORD:Verification Failed: 'Auth' ['CRV1:<flags>:<state_id>:<user_b64>:<challenge_text>']` — a SEPARATE round trip. This requires `--auth-retry interact` on the openvpn subprocess (`Connect()` in manager.go): without it, OpenVPN's core just exits on that "failure" instead of restarting and re-prompting. Once it restarts, a bare `Need 'Auth'` prompt returns and must be answered with `password "Auth" CRV1::<state_id>::<response>` — the SAME username as the original login, not anything new.

Because CRV1's challenge and its answering prompt arrive on two different lines with an OpenVPN-driven restart in between, `Manager` tracks `entry.pendingChallenge` across that gap: `onMgmtDynamicChallenge` (triggered by the "Verification Failed" line) notifies the GUI and stores the challenge WITHOUT blocking, so the management read loop keeps processing (state changes, the eventual retry prompt); `onMgmtAuthPrompt` (triggered by the next `Need 'Auth'` line) picks up the pending challenge, blocks waiting for the GUI's reply exactly like a plain prompt does, and formats it onto the wire. `entry.lastUsername` remembers the username across this gap since the GUI's CRV1 form shows no username field to resend one.

The GUI-facing IPC surface stays deliberately thin: `AuthPromptEventPayload` carries `challenge_kind` ("" / "static" / "dynamic") + display fields (text/echo/concat) but never the CRV1 state ID — that's a wire-protocol implementation detail the frontend never touches. `FeedCredentials` gained one new `response` parameter; the backend alone decides how to combine it with the username/password depending on `challenge_kind`.

## Reconnect

### Sleep/Wake Detection

Two mechanisms (both send to the same channel):

1. **NSWorkspace.didWakeNotification** (cgo) — instant detection
2. **Wall-clock polling** (fallback) — 10s interval, 30s threshold

### Health Check (optional, off by default)

Polls handshake age via wgctrl every 30 seconds. If no handshake for 180 seconds (`RejectAfterTime`), triggers **per-tunnel reconnect**. The monitor calls `AllStatuses()` to check each tunnel individually -- if a specific tunnel's handshake is stale, only that tunnel is disconnected and reconnected via `triggerReconnectTunnel(name)`.

Recommended only with `PersistentKeepalive` — without it, idle tunnels exceed the threshold naturally.

### Reconnect Callback

`ReconnectFunc` accepts a tunnel name parameter:

```go
type ReconnectFunc func(name string) error
```

In the helper, `reconnectFn(name)` looks up the cached config from `activeCfgs map[string]*WireGuardConfig`:
- **name non-empty**: reconnects only that specific tunnel
- **name empty** (legacy sleep/wake path): reconnects all cached tunnels

### Reconnect Flow

```
Health check detects stale handshake on tunnel "work"
  → triggerReconnectTunnel("work")
    → suspendFirewall()            # disable kill switch (old utun rules)
    → manager.DisconnectTunnel("work")
    → reconnectFn("work")         # manager.Connect(cachedCfgs["work"])
    → resumeFirewall()            # re-enable with NEW utun + endpoints

Wake detected (all tunnels)
  → triggerReconnect()
    → triggerReconnectTunnel("")   # reconnects all cached tunnels
```

**Exponential backoff**: 5s initial, 60s max, unlimited attempts.

**Firewall suspend/resume**: on reconnect, utun name changes (utun4->utun5). Old kill switch rules block the new interface. Suspending before disconnect and resuming after connect with fresh interface/endpoints prevents this deadlock.

## Helper Version Sync

GUI and helper share the same binary (`wireguide` / `wireguide --helper`). On startup, `ensureHelper` pings the helper and compares `AppVersion`:

- Match -> use existing helper
- Mismatch -> Shutdown RPC -> `ForceReinstall` -> `installAndLoadDaemon` (bootout old, copy new binary, bootstrap)

This handles `brew upgrade` which replaces the app bundle but leaves the old helper running via KeepAlive.

## IPC Protocol

JSON-RPC 2.0 over Unix domain socket. Socket permissions: `0600`, peer UID verified via `SO_PEERCRED`.

| Method | Direction | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `Helper.Ping` | GUI->Helper | Version check, liveness |
| `Helper.Shutdown` | GUI->Helper | Graceful helper shutdown |
| `Helper.Subscribe` | GUI->Helper | Subscribe to event notifications |
| `Helper.SetLogLevel` | GUI->Helper | Change runtime log level |
| `Tunnel.Connect` | GUI->Helper | Start VPN tunnel (`ConnectRequest`) |
| `Tunnel.Disconnect` | GUI->Helper | Stop tunnel (`DisconnectRequest`, optional `TunnelName`) |
| `Tunnel.Status` | GUI->Helper | Connection state + stats |
| `Tunnel.IsConnected` | GUI->Helper | Boolean connected check |
| `Tunnel.ActiveName` | GUI->Helper | Name of first active tunnel |
| `Tunnel.ActiveTunnels` | GUI->Helper | List all active tunnel names (`ActiveTunnelsResponse`) |
| `Firewall.SetKillSwitch` | GUI->Helper | Enable/disable pf rules |
| `Firewall.SetDNSProtection` | GUI->Helper | Enable/disable DNS-only pf rules |
| `Monitor.SetHealthCheck` | GUI->Helper | Toggle per-tunnel health check |
| `Network.SetPinInterface` | GUI->Helper | Toggle `-ifscope` route pinning |
| `event.status` | Helper->GUI | 1 Hz status broadcast |
| `event.reconnect` | Helper->GUI | Reconnect state changes |
| `event.log` | Helper->GUI | Structured log entries |

### Key Request/Response Types

| Type | Used By | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `ConnectRequest` | `Tunnel.Connect` | Contains `*WireGuardConfig` |
| `DisconnectRequest` | `Tunnel.Disconnect` | Optional `TunnelName`; empty = disconnect first active tunnel |
| `ActiveTunnelsResponse` | `Tunnel.ActiveTunnels` | `Names []string` |
| `SetPinInterfaceRequest` | `Network.SetPinInterface` | `Enabled bool` |
| `SetHealthCheckRequest` | `Monitor.SetHealthCheck` | `Enabled bool` |
| `SetLogLevelRequest` | `Helper.SetLogLevel` | `Level string` |
| `MultiStatusResponse` | `Tunnel.Status` | Aggregate state + per-tunnel `[]ConnectionStatus` |

## Error Handling

### Typed Errors

```go
type TunnelError struct {
    Kind    ErrorKind  // ErrAlreadyConnected, ErrNetwork, ErrTimeout, etc.
    Message string
    Cause   error
}
```

Frontend can type-assert `ErrorKind` to show different UI for "already connected" vs "DNS failed" vs "timeout". Multi-tunnel adds `ErrFullTunnelConflict` (two full-tunnels conflict) and `ErrTransitionInProgress` (another connect/disconnect in flight for the same tunnel name).

### Crash Recovery

Active tunnel state is persisted to `{dataDir}/active-tunnel.json` after all connect phases succeed. On helper restart:

1. Load state file
2. Restore routing state (table/fwmark)
3. Restore DNS from pre-modification snapshot (or reset to DHCP defaults)
4. Remove stale routes
5. Flush firewall anchors
6. Clear state file

### Panic Recovery

All background goroutines wrapped in `goSafe()` — recovers panics, logs stack trace, restarts up to 5 times with 1s backoff. IPC connection handlers individually wrapped to prevent one bad RPC from crashing the helper.

## Update Flow

| Install method | Update mechanism |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Homebrew | `brew update && brew upgrade --cask wireguide` (GUI triggers) |
| Binary zip | Opens GitHub Releases page in browser |

Homebrew cask `uninstall` block only quits the app (no sudo). Helper cleanup is in `zap` (full removal only). This allows `brew upgrade` without sudo.

## Design Decisions

### Why wireguard-go instead of NetworkExtension?

| | wireguard-go | NetworkExtension |
|---|---|---|
| Platforms | macOS, Windows, Linux | Apple only |
| Kill switch | Full control (pf/nftables) | Limited (on-demand rules) |
| Sleep/wake | Custom handler | Commented out in Passepartout |
| App Store | Not possible | Required |
| Root required | Yes (TUN device) | No (sandboxed) |

WireGuide chose wireguard-go for cross-platform support and full control over networking. The tradeoff is requiring root and not being distributable via App Store.

### Why Go + Wails instead of Swift/Electron?

- **Go**: same language as wireguard-go, no FFI overhead, single binary
- **Wails v3**: native webview (not Chromium), ~15MB binary vs ~150MB Electron
- **Svelte**: smallest bundle size among major frameworks, no virtual DOM

### Why pf anchors instead of modifying main ruleset?

macOS Tahoe's `pfctl -sr` outputs `scrub-anchor` directives that cause syntax errors when re-loaded. Using anchors avoids touching the main ruleset entirely — `com.apple.*` wildcard evaluates our rules automatically.
